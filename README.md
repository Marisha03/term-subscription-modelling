This project aims to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit using classification models on a banking dataset. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and contains client and campaign-related features.

The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.
